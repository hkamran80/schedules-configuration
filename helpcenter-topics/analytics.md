Schedules collects anonymous analytics though the open-source analytics platform
[Umami](https://umami.is/). No personally-identifiable information is ever stored
on our servers.

Umami's goal is to provide privacy-focused analytics, and therefore does not collect
any personally identifiable information (PII), and anonymizes all data collected.

Data collected by Umami includes:

- Pages visited
- The referrer (where you came from)
- What time Schedules was accessed
- The browser
- The operating system (e.g. "macOS," "Windows 10," etc.)
- The type of device (mobile, desktop, laptop)
- The country you are accessing Schedules from
